down by the bay 
where the watermelon grow 
back to my home
i dare not go 
for if i do
my mother will say 
did you ever see a bee drinking some tea
down by the bay 
down by the bay 
where the watermelon grow 
back to my home
i dare not go 
for if i do
my mother will say 
did you ever see a fish washing a dish
down by the bay

* The hdfs localhost move from http://localhost:50070 to http://localhost:9870
# Force to remove folder in hadoop
>> hadoop fs -rm -r '/FolderName'

# To Compile a project (as WordCount for example)
1. Generate a folder remotedly to hdfs server
>> hadoop fs -mkdir '/FolderName'

2. Put file remotedly to hdfs server
>> hadoop fs -put '/FileName' '/FolderOfHadoop'

3. Compile to java classes locally
>> javac -classpath $(hadoop classpath) -d 'ClassesFolder'   'WordCount.java'
#					  folder of classes    java file

4. Recompile into JAR file via classes
>> jar -cvf WordCount.jar  -C  ClassesFolder/ .
#             jar file         folder of classes

5. Conduct hdfs operation via JAR file to extract output
>> hadoop jar 'WordCount.jar'     WordCount       '/Input'    '/Output'
#	         jar file        MainClassName   hdfs Input  hdfs Output

6. Review output of hdfs
>> hdfs dfs -cat /Output/*
#		hdfs output
